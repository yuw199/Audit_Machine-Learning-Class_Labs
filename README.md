IEOR 142 -  Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Analytics

I would like to share the four intersting labs that I have done using the machine learning techniques. 

I have had a chance to audit Berkeley IEOR 142. This course introduces me to key techniques in machine learning and data analytics through a diverse set of examples using real datasets from domains such as e-commerce, healthcare, social media, sports, the Internet, and more. I have gained experience understanding and applying techniques to the real world data sights and offer insights to the business decision behind the data.
